# JSON Project
Haskell JSON project to convert a String into a JsonObject and a JsonObject into a String
## How to use it
Build the project in your terminal with "stack build" and then run it with "stack run". This will run the examples of the functions toJsonString and toJsonObject from the JsonLibrary module in the src folder. You can also run these functions using ghci in a terminal inside the app folder to run "main" or inside the src folder to use the mentioned functions. 
You can change the examples from the JsonLibrary module to view different scenarios.
